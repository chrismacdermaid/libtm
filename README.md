Custom TCL Math Library

This is an ugly hack of a code used to do some basic math routines in TCL,
most of the routines are verbatim VMD routines, others from LAMMPS, and others
still from my own personal implementations. This code is free to use inline
with both the GPLv2 (the lammps parts) and the UIUC open source license (VMD
parts). Of course, no warranty, no support, don't contact me if you use it and
it breaks your stuff. You probably shouldn't be using this anyway.
